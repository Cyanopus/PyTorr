PyTorr
======

Small lightweight torrent-client based on Python+libtorrent


This is a small project for the Python training course in FMI/SU. It will contain basic functionallity of a bittorrent client warped up in GUI. There will be both CLI or GUI usage depends of the user needs.

During next two weeks, my goal will be to clear out the arsenal of features and finish some of them in the core. Next goals are wraping up the core with GUI and CLI and putting some finish view over the application.
